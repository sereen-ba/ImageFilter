# ImageFilter
Using OpenCV python 

___________
Python has many applications; one of them was image processing and graphic design applications.

In this project, the user enters a specific image, and the software creates a new window and applies the filter on it along with the control window
 This filter plays with three features: Sigma, blend, Str_sigma.
  So it plays with the blinding of the color and the appearance of the picture.
As you can update on your picture using the control panel and apply your adjust while the software is running.
